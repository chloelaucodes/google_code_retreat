# Google Code Retreat

## Introduction

This repository stores different versions of code of the 6 sessions (excluding the first) made in the Code Retreat, for the challenge _Conway's Game of Life_.

### Personal Thoughts 
I have had the opportunity to pair code with Googlers for 3 of those sessions, and see a significant growth in completion of task within the event despite the different given challenges every session, with the last two having a full completion with time to spare on extensional development.

## Usage

This folder contains 5 Java files, which are the different implementations of _Conway's Game of Life_. It stores the functionality for the challenge but does not have a simulator to run with it. This is, to be implemented for leisure.

## Style

This repository generally follows Google Code Style. Some variable and function names, alongside wrapping, may not structly adhere to Google Code Style.

## Testing

Most of the files contains test suites as part of a Test Driven Development method. They are Java Unit Tests implemented within each session.
