# google_code_retreat

This repo stores different codes (excluding the first) made in the Code Retreat, for the challenge of Conway's Game of Life.
I was very glad to have had Googlers to pair code with me for some of the projects, though out the event, we reached more completion and by the last two a successful completion of the task with time left in a very different code style each.
